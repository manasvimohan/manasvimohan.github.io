# Chaos in my mind
Whenever planning for any project, I often think of the structure of the whole idea. While thinking about it, I have observed, not only with myself, but with most people, that defining the structure in the start is always a tough thing to do.

For example, in this blog, I can create categories, and at initial stage I do not know where I want to start or what I want to do, let alone thinking of categorizing stuff, which will come in the future.

However I am thinking of starting by broad range of categories, and then later on fine tune them as time passes.

Secondly, the concept of using tags is really good, which means that I can tag each blog with the most relevant topics or feelings and the later things will get sorted out automatically.

Using tags, I can also go on creating some kind of a script to organise myself later.

# Currently what I am planning
Following things I think I will cover:
1. Blogs for on each organisation I worked in, and the people who made me what I am.
2. Blogs on day to day thoughts I come across, which are worth documenting.
3. Things that I learn as routine, which I feel will be useful for others too.
4. Snippets of my projects that I work on, and with intention that people with similar interests can join me.
5. My activity on the internet, Youtube videos that I make, or posts on twitter, linkedin or medium or any other place, like facebook or instagram.

# Closing Note
Well that's all I am thinking of at the moment.

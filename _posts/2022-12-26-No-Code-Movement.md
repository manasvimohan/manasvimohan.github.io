# Overview
There has been a lot of news on low-code and no-code developments and [Gartner](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/gartner-low-code-development-adoption/) predicts that by 2026, low-code developers will account for around 80% of total developers. Keeping this in mind, and reading other news, I explored the available famous tools these days, which are proving to be a success and are presented in this blog.

# The basic idea
So I want to note down everything that I observe and learn, in hopes to create a second brain. At the same time, I also wish to share my knowledge with everyone. Hence I have come up with this system, as described below.

# They System
1. For mobile based information, capture my observations through telegram or github issues.
2. For desktop, create the screenshot capture with comment based system on python.
3. For browser links, create a fly note system, as I did earlier for linux system, the same for windows.
4. A script to aggregate all the information into a singe db.
5. Display the observations based on some criteria to myself to generate ideas.
6. Content created for the public will be posted in the form of blog here.
7. Documentation, wiki and notes will be posted on mkdocs based website.
8. I will log my activity in the capture system itself, with special tags.
9. Whatever I do, all of it gets updated on all front ends daily.

# Exit notes
I know as a reader you guys might not understand what this strategy is, hence will write a proper article on this, once the system is ready.
